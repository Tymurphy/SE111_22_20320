                <p>In my opinion I find the movie hilarious. As the show always has a twist on every topic that the group of kids explore. I also like how the show includes so many celebrities and makes fun of them. For an example, when the town was over run by people from New Jersey and Snooki (from Jersey Shore) was one of the main vilians. Also when they have a simple problem amongst each other it turns into a big ordeal which makes the show very interesting. As you always have to stay on your toes as you never know what is going to happen next.</p>

                <p>I believe that many people would enjoy the show as much as I do. I also think that more people should watch the show.</p>
